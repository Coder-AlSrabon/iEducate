          Education began in prehistory, as adults trained the young in the knowledge and skills deemed necessary in their society. In pre-literate societies, skills from one generation to the next. As cultures began to extend their knowledge beyond skills that could be readily learned through imitation, formal education developed. Schools existed in Egypt at the time of the Middle Kingdom.

          The Aztecs also had a well-developed theory about education, which has an equivalent word in Nahuatl called tlacahuapahualiztli. It means "the art of raising or educating a person",[6] or "the art of strengthening or bringing up men". This was a broad conceptualization of education and reinforced by community living. Historians cite that formal education was mandatory for everyone regardless of social class and gender.

          The Renaissance in Europe ushered in a new age of scientific and intellectual inquiry and appreciation of ancient Greek and Roman civilizations. Around 1450, Johannes Gutenberg developed a printing press, which allowed works of literature to spread more quickly. The European Age of Empires saw European ideas of education in philosophy, religion, arts and sciences spread out across the globe.
